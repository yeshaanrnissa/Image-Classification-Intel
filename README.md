# Image-Classification-Intel
This project uses the Intel Image Classification dataset, which consists of natural scene images categorized into 6 classes: buildings, forest, glacier, mountain, sea, and street. The goal of this project is to build an image classification model using deep learning to automatically recognize the type of scene from an input image.
