# Intel Image Classification Project
This project uses the Intel Image Classification dataset, which consists of natural scene images categorized into 6 classes: buildings, forest, glacier, mountain, sea, and street. The goal of this project is to build an image classification model using deep learning to automatically recognize the type of scene from an input image.

## Acknowledgement
This project was created as part of my learning journey from Dicoding’s Machine Learning Course.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the **Intel Image Classification Dataset**.

## Results
The final model achieved an accuracy of 86% on the validation set. 
The model was exported into multiple formats: SavedModel, TF Lite, and TFJS for deployment flexibility.
